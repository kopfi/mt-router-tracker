# MikroTik Router Tracking Scripts

This repository will soon contain a loose bundle of MikroTik-Scripts, that can be used to determine the position of a
mobile WLAN/UMTS Router based upon the radio-stations it receives.

This is solely a proof of concept project. You may use and alter these scripts as you wish, as long as you stick to the terms
of the GNU GPLv3.
